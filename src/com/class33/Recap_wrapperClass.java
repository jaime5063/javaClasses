/*
 * Wrapper Class --> convert non primitive to the object type
 * 
 * why do we need Wrapper class?
 * Wrapper Classes are used to store data in Collections.
 * 
 * What is it?
 * Collections are the containers that store group of Objects
 * 
 * Why do we need Collections?
 * - to manipulate data.
 * - Arrays are limited in size and not ready to manipulate data
 * 
 * Collection (Collection Framework) consist of 3 interfaces:
 * - List
 * - Set
 * - Queue
 * 
 * - List: Collection that have duplicate elements and preserve the order
 * 
 * ArrayList (major use as automation testers)
 * LinkedList
 * Vector (not using almost at all)
 * 
 * 
 * Iterator:
 * - is an interface that helps to iterate/traverse through each element inside the collection (List, Set, queue).
 * 
 * Iterator we have 3 methods:
 * - hasNext(); --> returns boolean if there is a next element in the collections 
 * - next(); --> returns that next element
 * - remove(); -- Removes that next element
 * 
 * Each collection will have an access to the iterator method that will be 
 * 	returning 1 object the iterator type
 * 
 * Iterator:
 * - starts looping from beginning of collection and ends at the end of the collection
 *

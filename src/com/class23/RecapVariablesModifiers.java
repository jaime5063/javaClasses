public class RecapVariablesModifiers {

/*
 * Local - variables declared inside the method, constructor on the block
 * instance - declared inside the class but outside the method
 * 
 *  access instance variables -  create the object	
 *  	- they belong to the instance not the class itself
 *  	- if you make changes it'll only affect that instance
 *  
 *  static variables - variables declared inside the class 
 *  	- they belong to the class
 *  	- if changed they will all be affected
 *  
 *  NON-static variables - cannot be used with static and vise versa
 *  
 *  
 *  // CAR EXAMPLE:
 *  Car car1=new Car();
 *  Car - ClassName
 *  Car1 - object reference variable
 *  = - assigning operator
 *  new - keyword used to create an object
 *  car() - constructor
 *  ; - end of statement
 *  
 *  constructor - special method / block of code that is being executed when we create an object(instance) 
 *  	of the class
 *  	- Will always have the same name as your class name
 *  
 *  	- How can we create the constructor
 *  		- 1. It should have exact name as your class name
 *  		- 2. Cannot have return type, not even void
 *  
 *  	- How is constructor executed
 *  		- every time we create an object we call a constructor and entire  block of code inside 
 *  			constructor will be executed first
 *  
 *  	- If we do not create any constructor --> compiler will create one default constructor
 *  
 *  	- Why do we need the constructor?
 *  		- constructor initialize the OBJECT
 *

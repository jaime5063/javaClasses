/* Interface:
 * Interface is similar to class. Another way to achieve abstraction.
 * There can only be abstract methods.
 * Collection of methods that have no implementation.
 * 
 * We can have multiple inheritance. 
 * 	Multiple parents, example:
 * 	- class Test1 extends Test2 implements InterfaceTest{}
 * 
 * Majority of the time we will be specifying behaviors (methods)
 * 
 * Relationships:
 * from class to class = extends
 * from class to interface = implementation
 * 
 * You can implement multiple interfaces to your class with a ','
 * 
 * with interface we achieve 100% Abstraction

/*
 * The 4 major OOPS CONCEPTS
 * Inheritance - direct access to properties of the parent class
 * 
 * Polymorphism - compile time and runtime (method overloading) , (method overriding)
 * 
 * Abstraction - the process of hiding implementation and only showing what you want. 
 * 			-->	 process of: hiding implementations - showing main functionality
 * 	 can be achieved in 2 ways:
 * 		- Abstract class = class is incomplete
 * 		- Interfaces 
 * 	 Abstract class is a class defined with 'abstract' keyword and has:
 * 		- implemented (has body)
 * 		- unimplemented (no body)
 * 	 Abstract: is a non access modifier. 
 * 			   is a keyword that identifies something is incomplete (class is incomplete)
 * 
 * 		abstract class: public abstract void example();
 *  	non abstract class: public abstract void example(){   --> compiler will give you an error
 *  						}
 *   	- with 'abstraction' you will always have inheritance.
 *   
 *   Questions:
 *   	- can an abstract class be private? 
 *   		No, every abstract class must use inheritance to define all methods
 *   
 *   	- can an abstract class be final?
 *   		No, you will need to override it and with final that would be impossible
 *   
 *   	- can an abstract method be static?
 *   		No, because you cannot override a static method. You can only overload static method.
 *   
 *   	- can an abstract class have a constructor? (HOMEWORK)
 *   		HW
 *     
 *   	- can an abstract class have a static and non static variables? (HOMEWORK)	
 *   		HW
 *   
 * Encapsulation -

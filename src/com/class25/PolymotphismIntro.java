/*
 * What is Polymorphism
 * - the ability of an object of an object to take on many forms
 * Store:
 * 	- behaving like a customer
 * Student:
 *  - behaving like a student
 * 
 * Polymorphism is the capability of a method
 * 
 * 2 Types
 * - compile Time Polymorphism / Static Binding / Early binding - method overloading
 * 	 Method overloading - having same method name within the same class by having different number of parameters or 
 * 	 different type.
 * 
 * - Run Time Plymorphism / Dynamic Binding / Late Binding
 * 	 Method overriding - 
 * 
 * Overloading:
 * - Methods
 * - Constructors
 * 
 * 
 * Can we overload PRIVATE methods? Yes. changing the number of parameters or type.
 * 
 * Can we overload a MAIN method? Yes. changing the number of parameters or type.
 * 
 * Can we overload STATIC method? Yes.
 * 
 * TASK:
 * Create a class named ‘Programming’. While creating an object of the class, if nothing is passed to it, 
 * then the message “I love programming languages” should be printed. If some String is passed to it, 
 * then in place of “programming languages” the value variable should be printed. 
 * Example, if we pass “Java”, then “I love Java” should be printed.
 * 
Create 1 class with a static method that has 3 overloaded forms. 
Then call each overloaded method with specific arguments and observe result.

Create 1 class with a private method that has 3 overloaded forms. 
Then call each overloaded method with specific arguments and observe result.

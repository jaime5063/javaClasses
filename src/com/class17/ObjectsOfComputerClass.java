/*
 * What is a class?
A class is a user defined blueprint from which individual objects are created.

What is an object?
Objects are instances that are created from classes.
Or An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. 
Object is a basic unit of Object Oriented Programming and represents the real life entities.

Software objects and a real-world objects have very similar characteristics. 
Software objects also have a state and a behavior.
A software object’s state is stored in fields/attributes and behavior is shown via methods.

State: It is represented by attributes of an object.
Behavior: It is represented by methods of an object.

Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.
